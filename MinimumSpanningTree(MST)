Spanning Tree-

-A tree in which we have n number of nodes and n-1 number of edges and in which
we can able to reach from any one node to any other node is MST.

-That means all nodes are reachable from each other.

-The minimum spanning tree is one which have least sum of the costs or weights
of the edges.

example-
   2      3                       2      3
0------1-----2  sum=16        0------1------2  sum=20
|      |                             /      /
|6     |5                         8 /    7 /  
|      |                           /      /
3      4                           3      4


We can find mst using two algorithms these are-
1.Prim 's Algorithm
2.Kruskal Algorithm (Using Disjoint Set data structure)
