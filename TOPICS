//Graph Important topics

1.BFS-Used when the you have to find the minimum (cost,transformations,etc)
      as it travels in level wise manner.
      MultiSource bfs is very asked.


2.DFS-When you have to travel in depth first manner.

3.Dijkstra Algo-Same as bfs but PriorityQueue is used.It used to find 
                shortest path.(IMP)

4.TopoLogical Sort-Used in question where we need to chk whether we can able
                   to perform certain task before other.(Finishing task question of interviewbit)
                   ->Also used in cycle detection of graph as if we wre not able to perform
                     topo sort on graph that means there is a cycle present as topo sort can only
                     be performed on DAG.

5.MST-To find the minimum possible cost of connected all nodes together. 
     -Can be easily perform using DSU and the algo is called Kruskal Algo.
      (Refer MST_Easy)

6.Bipartite Graph-Can we able to split the graph into two groups.(two teams question of interviewbit)
                  Also known as graph coloring problem.
                  -If we able to color the graph with two diff color such that
                   no two neighbours have same color.

7.Cycle detection- FOR UNDIRECTED GRAPH-1.BY DFS
                                        2.by BFS
                                        3.By DSU

                    FOR DIRECTED GRAPH-1.By Topo sort
                                       2.By DFS and BFS(Path visited concept)
